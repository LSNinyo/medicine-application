1. Bug when saving a new medicine with the name of an existing one.
    Exact case:
        When trying to save a new medicine with the Name of an existing one and
        with a different price.
    What happens:
        Initially, the main text area shows the new price. It also shows only the
        quantity provided by the new medicine request.
        After selecting another medicine from the search list and then going back
        to this one, however, it shows the old price but now with incremented
        quantity.
