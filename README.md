# medicine-application

This is a simple Java application with minimalistic GUI that is designed to be used in a small pharmacy. It provides functionality for storing a medicine's name, price and quantity. It also allows the user to sell the medicine or add some to inventory. The medicine and inventory are stored in a database. A daily log file is created automatically, after closing the application, which keeps track of what has been sold this day.

It is written using JDK 11 and JavaFX. It also uses the SQLite drivers for JDBC.
